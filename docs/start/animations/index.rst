Tile Animations
===============

One of the range of LIFX products is the LIFX Tile. This device is a square
panel with 64 LEDs that come in sets of 5. This product has been discontinued
and aren't being made anymore but they're still fun to play with!

Photons provides the ability to run animations on these tiles where a constant
stream of messages are sent to the tiles to make it appear like movement. These
work across multiple sets of the tiles as if they were all connected to each
other, as opposed to firmware effects that are only per set of tiles.

.. note:: For it to appear like the tiles are one, they need to be
    :ref:`arranged <app_tile_arranger>` to know where they are in relation to
    each other.

Photons come with a selection of built in animations and has a public interface
for defining your own.
