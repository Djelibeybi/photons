Building your own animations
============================

It is possible to build your own tile animations. I have yet to write good
documentation to explain how.

In the meantime, this
`example <https://github.com/delfick/photons/blob/main/examples/tile_animation>`_
is a good place to start for making your own animation and the
`folder <https://github.com/delfick/photons/tree/main/modules/photons_canvas/animations/registered>`_
containing the built in animations is a good start for an idea of what's
possible.

If you have any problems, questions, or requests, please don't hesitate to
post a `question <https://github.com/delfick/photons/issues>`_ on the
project's github page.
